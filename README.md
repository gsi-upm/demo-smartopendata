==================================

##Introduction
This demo is a semantic visualization tool that uses [SEFARAD](https://github.com/gsi-upm/Sefarad). This tool provides mechanisms for enabling non skilled users to visualize linked data sources with a high level description of classes, properties and relations. By using a map faceted navigation capability users are able to go beyond data exploration to map visualization filtering features. Furthermore, SEFARAD provides an utility for creating and processing human-readable SPARQL queries which can be used for representing linked data information.
